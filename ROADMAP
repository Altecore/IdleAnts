IdleAnts RoadMap

Legend
  Stuff to do follows the order of the numbers next to it
    (+) Means extrastuff after the main stuff is done
    (/) Main stuff
    [Text] ... (+ ...) Stuff between the parentheses is other things this block should create with
    (?) Ideas, will I do it, will I not?
    (ref.) Reference to another point in the roadmap
    [Text] ... ✔️ Means it's done and working
  
(/) 1. Learn JavaScript :

      (?) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh
      (?) https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-javascript-series
      (?)

(/) 2. GitHub Tutorial
        (+)Learn about GIT first, then Github :) - Charles

(/) 3. Working framework : https://github.com/Flaque/merchant.js
    (/) 3.1. Ressource counter (+ button to collect)
        (+) 3.1.1. Dirt, leaves, stones, sticks
    (/) 3.2. Spending ressources button (+ affects counter, + gives item/building)

(/) 4. Once framework is working, expand it with more ressources and buildings
    (/) 4.1.
    (/) 4.2.

(/) 5. Add the population mechanic
    (/) 5.1. First building to build with ressources, to host ants (ref. 3.2.)
    (/) 5.2. Population affects production of ressources (ref. 3.1. + 3.2.)

    
Idea dump
    Different ant races (gives different buffs to production of certain ressources)
        Warrior races (the fighting stats will be present even if less efficient in other races, make sure that these races give a true advantage somewhere by making the fighting mechanic useful for certain ressources or progression)
            Full defence (+find ant race with the big ass heads)
            Full offence (+find ant race with formic acid)
            Hybrid (+red fire ants?)
        Scout race (+bullet ants?)
        Population race (+brown ants species)
        Farming races
            Outside foraging (+???)
            Inside farming (+find mushroom farming ant race)
    Exploration
        Different locations to discover, take over, and where to forage for ressources or fight
            Houses, villages, garden, cave, etc. etc.
    Prestige system
        Genetic engineering (to discover in the first run, so you discover this system first, which unlocks new mechanics)
                Ant intelligence developpement (the basic upgrade, gives intelligence to the ants, which unlocks other systems such as science, religion, art and all)
                Ant millitary upgrades (modify or add body parts to make speed, defence, offence, replicative speed and all more efficient)
        Ressource production bonuses
        Automatisation upgrades (ad Antimatter Dimension style)
    ASCII graphics
    World map expansion, new territories, ressources, etc.
        Space exploration?
            Ants = Galaxy supremacy?
