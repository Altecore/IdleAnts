# IdleAnts

Welcome to the passion project of two friends. We want to create a fun idle game while learning some programming along the way.

<h1>Description</h1>
IdleAnts is an idle game where your goal is to ensure the survival of your ant colony. Start by feeding your first ant and grow from there.
Currently, our plans are only to make a browser based game. If you want to help port the game to mobile devices, please contact us.
